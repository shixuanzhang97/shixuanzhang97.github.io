 <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>This game is my favorite game, it called PLAYER UNKNOWN'S BATTLE GROUNDS.PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is a multiplayer online battle royale game developed and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of South Korean publisher Bluehole.</strong> </p>
 <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The most interesting thing in this game is that you need to find your weapon from rooms in each of building, and you don't know what weapons you will get. maybe good weapon,or bad weapons. the most unlucky thing in this game is that you find everywhere, and you can't find any weapon. and then other players will kill you.</strong>
